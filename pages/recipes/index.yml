Here are some recipes I enjoy cooking.

I have been collecting simple, tasty, and nutritious recipes.

I like to focus on using a small variety of ingredients, so I can easily keep
them in stock.

- onion
- minced garlic
- tinned tomatos
- tomato paste
- sliced mushrooms
- potatos
- vegetable stock (I use [Vegeta](https://www.vegeta.com.au/au/products/original/vegeta-gourmet-stock-powder))
- Capsicum (aka Bell Pepper)

I'm also vegetarian, so I tend to prefer mock meats:

- [Quorn "chicken" chunks](https://www.quorn.com.au/products/quorn-pieces)
- [Mock bacon](https://www.madewithplants.com.au/bacon)
