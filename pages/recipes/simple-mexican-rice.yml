This is a simple recipe I adapted from one I [found
online](https://www.today.com/recipes/one-pot-mexican-rice-black-beans-corn-t47411)
when looking for something to cook using black beans.

Black beans are a rich source if iron, which is important for people like me
who avoid meat.

## Serves: 4

## Ingredients:

- 1 tbsp Olive oil
- 1 onion, diced finely
- 1 med red capsicum, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup frozen corn kernels
- 1 can (400g) black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 can (400g) diced tomatoes, with juices
- 2 tsp chilli flakes
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp vegetable stock powder (I use [Vegeta](https://www.vegeta.com.au/au/products/original/vegeta-gourmet-stock-powder))
- 1 cup jasmine rice

## Steps:

1. mix cumin, chilli, and stock powder into 1.5 cups water; stir until well mixed
1. heat oil in a large, deep fry pan
1. add onion and capsicum; fry until soft (~5 mins)
1. Add garlic, corn, and black beans; stir until heated (~2mins)
1. add spice/water mix, tomatoes, and rice to the pan (salt + pepper to taste)
1. stir, bring to boil, and simmer to reduce for ~20 mins, or until rice is soft.

The original recipe I found didn't include the stock, and melted jack cheese
through as the final step.
