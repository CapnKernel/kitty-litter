Rajma is an Indian word for red kidney beans. These beans are a great source of
iron, protein, and fibre.

I've adapted this recipe from a collection of sources, and adjusted for simpler
cooking by using tinned ingredients.

## Serves: 4

## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp ghee
- 1 med onion, sliced finely
- 1 tbsp minced garlic+ginger
- 1 can (400g) diced tomato, with juices
- 2 cans (400g ea) red kidney beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 cayenne chilli, sliced finely (remove seeds for low spiciness)
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 tsp ground coriander seed
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp garam masala
- &frac12; tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp amchur powder
- &frab12; tsp hing
- 2 cups water
- salt to taste

### Note

If using dried beans, soak overnight (or at least 8 hours), and boil for 20-30
minutes beforehand.

## Steps

1. on a low heat, melt ghee
1. add cumin seeds, cook until the sizzling reduces
1. add onion + chilli, fry until soft [optionally, until carmelised]
1. add coriander, cumin, garam masala, and turmeric; saute until aromatic (10 - 20 seconds)
1. add garlic+ginger paste, mix well, simmer for ~30 seconds
1. add tomatos, mix and simmer until oil starts to separate (2 - 3 minutes) 
1. add beans, 2 cups water, hing, amchur powder
1. reduce heat, allow to simmer until sauce thickens and beans are soft to mushy
  (20 - 30 minutes)

Seve over steamed/boiled rice.
