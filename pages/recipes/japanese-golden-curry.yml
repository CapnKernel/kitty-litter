This uses a product by [S & B
Foods](https://www.sbfoods-worldwide.com/products/search/016.html) to do all t
he hard work.

This is more or less the recipe on the box, but I include [Fabel mock
beef](https://fablefood.co/) to round out the textures, and add some extra
protein.

## Serves: 4

## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp oil
- 1 onion, diced finely
- 1 large carrot, sliced into semicircles
- 2 med potatos, diced ~1cm cubes
- 1 pack Golden Curry mix
- 250g (1 box) Fabel mock braised beef

## Steps

1. in a medium pot, heat the oil
1. add carrot and potato, fry for ~5 mins
1. add water, bring to boil, and simmer for ~15mins
1. add mock beef
1. break up golden curry blocks, and stir through until completely melted
1. allow to simmer for ~5mins more, stirring constantly

Serve on rice or noodles.
