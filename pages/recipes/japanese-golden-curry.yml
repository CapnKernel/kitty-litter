This uses a product by [S & B
Foods](https://www.sbfoods-worldwide.com/products/search/016.html) to do all
the hard work.

This is more or less the recipe on the box, but I include
[Fabel mock beef](https://fablefood.co/)
or
[Quorn "chicken" chunks](https://www.quorn.com.au/products/quorn-pieces)
to round out the textures, and add some extra protein.

## Serves: 4

## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp oil
- 1 onion, diced finely
- 1 large carrot, sliced into semicircles
- 2 med potatos, diced ~1cm cubes
- 1 pack Golden Curry mix
- 250g (1 box) Fabel mock braised beef

## Steps

1. in a medium pot, heat the oil
1. add carrot and potato, fry for ~5 mins
1. add 2-3 cups of water to cover everything
   This will need to be enough to keep the mock meet covered also.
   Bring to boil, and simmer for ~15mins
1. add mock meat
1. break up golden curry blocks, and stir through until completely melted
1. allow to simmer for ~5mins more, stirring constantly

Serve on rice or noodles.
