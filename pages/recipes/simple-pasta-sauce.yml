I was originally taught this by mother as a "bolognese" sauce, but calling it that seemed to offend Italians I know, so let's just go with "pasta sauce".

## Serves 4

## Ingredients:

- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 onion, diced finely
- 1 tbsp oregano
- 1 tbsp parsley
- 1 tsp thmye
- 400g sliced mushrooms
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 140g concentrated tomato paste
- 1 can (400g) diced tomatoes, with juices
- 500g [minced](https://www.naturli-foods.com/products/minced-3-0/) (minced beef if you like)

## Steps:

1. heat oil in a large saut&eacute; pan
1. add onion, fry until soft
1. add herbs; stir through
1. add minced; break up and stir, cook until browned
