We love a good "satay" sauce, so I found this simple to prepare, and hard to get wrong, solution.

## Serves: 4

## Ingredients

- 400g "singapore" noodles
- 1/2 cup water
- 1 tsp vegetable stock powder (I use [Vegeta](https://www.vegeta.com.au/au/products/original/vegeta-gourmet-stock-powder))
- 1 tbsp ginger paste
- 3 tbsp soy sauce
- 4 tbsp crunchy peanut butter
- 1 1/2 tbsp honey
- 2 tsp hot chilli paste (optional)
- 4 cloves garlic, crushed
- 4 spring onions, finely sliced (for garnish)


## Steps:

1. prepare your noodles as directed on the packet [typically soak in boiling water for a couple of minutes]
1. stir the stock powder into the water
1. add stock, ginger, soy sauce, peanut butter, honey, chilli paste, and garlic in a small saucepan.
1. head on low to medium heat until peanut butter melts
1. stir through noodles.


This does not provide a very exciting meal, but if you stir fry some carrots, bok choi, tofu, and mushrooms with the noodles, it can make for a satisfying meal.
