    <main><p>Those who've been reading my older posts may remember I showed how you could use Enum and IntEnum as a cleaner way to declare const-type values for choices lists in Django fields.</p>

<p>That solution never felt comfortable to me, because Enum values aren't simple values.</p>

<p>So after some playing around, and a brief look over the enum.py in python 3.5, I've come up with the following:</p>

<pre><code>class ChoiceProperty:
    '''Descriptor class for yielding values, but not allowing setting.'''
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __get__(self, instance, cls=None):
        return self.value


class MetaChoices(type):
    @classmethod
    def __prepare__(mcs, name, bases, **kwargs):
        '''Use an ordered dict for declared values.'''
        return OrderedDict()

    def __new__(mcs, name, bases, attrs):
        _choices = OrderedDict()
        _label_map = {}

        for name, value in list(attrs.items()):
            if not name.isupper():
                continue
            if isinstance(value, tuple):
                value, label = value
            else:
                label = name.title().replace('_', ' ')
            _choices[value] = label
            _label_map[label] = value
            attrs[name] = ChoiceProperty(value)
        attrs['_choices'] = _choices
        attrs['_labem_map'] = _label_map

        return type.__new__(mcs, name, bases, dict(attrs))

    def __getitem__(cls, key):
        return cls._choices[key]

    def __iter__(cls):
        return iter(cls._choices.items())


class Choices(metaclass=MetaChoices):
    '''Base class for choices constants.'''
</code></pre>

<h2>So, what does this all mean?</h2>

<p>First, there's the <code>ChoiceProperty</code>.  This follows the descriptor property so we can have attributes on our class that simply return a value they were told.
They do this irrespective of if it's on an instance or the class itself!</p>

<p>Last is the <code>Choices</code> class, which is empty except for declaring it has a metaclass.</p>

<p>In the middle is the meat of the work, of course.  A Metaclass defines what is done when you declare a class, or a subclass.  This lets you, as you can see here, iterate everything you're declaring on the class and do something with it <em>before</em> the class is declared.</p>

<p>So in this case it's finding all attributes of the class whose name is SHOUTY<em>SNAKE</em>CASE, and treating them as const declarations.</p>

<p>Either they're <code>NAME = Value</code>, and a label is created from the <code>NAME</code>, or they're <code>NAME = Value, Label</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>__getitem__</code> method is called when you try to subscribe the class (i.e. FOO[0]).</p>

<p>And the <code>__iter__</code> method when you try to iterate it.</p>

<h2>So what can I do with it?</h2>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class STATE_CHOICES(Choices):
...     NEW = 0
...     IN_PROGRESS = 1
...     REVIEW = 2, 'In Review'
...
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; STATE_CHOICES.NEW
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; STATE_CHOICES.IN_PROGRESS
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; STATE_CHOICES[2]
'In Review'
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(STATE_CHOICES)
[(0, 'New'), (1, 'In Progress'), (2, 'In Review')]
</code></pre>

<p>Now, does that look useful?</p>

<pre><code>class MyModel(models.Model):
    class STATUS(Choices):
        CLOSED = 0
        NEW = 1
        PENDING = 2, 'Process Pending'
        FAILED = -1, 'Processing Failed'

    status = models.IntegerField(choices=list(STATUS), default=STATUS.NEW)
</code></pre>
